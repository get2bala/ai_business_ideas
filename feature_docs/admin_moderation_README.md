# Admin/Moderation Tools

## Overview
Provide admin panel and moderation tools for managing ideas, users, and reported content.

## Utility Files Plan
- `admin_panel.js`: Utility to display and manage admin dashboard.
- `moderation_api.js`: Utility to handle moderation actions (approve, delete, ban, etc).

## Integration Plan
- Add a new admin dashboard page or modal, accessible only to admins.
- Use utilities to fetch, display, and manage moderation tasks.
- No changes to existing CRUD or UI logic; feature is additive and optional.
