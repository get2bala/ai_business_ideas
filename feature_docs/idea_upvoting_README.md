# Idea Upvoting/Rating

## Overview
Allow users to upvote or rate ideas to surface the best ones.

## Utility Files Plan
- `upvote_api.js`: Utility to handle upvote/rating API calls.
- `upvote_ui.js`: Utility to display upvote/rating buttons and counts.

## Integration Plan
- Add upvote/rating buttons to idea cards or modals.
- Use utilities to handle upvote actions and update UI.
- No changes to existing CRUD or UI logic; feature is additive and optional.
