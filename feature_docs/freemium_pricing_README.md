# Freemium/Pricing Integration

## Overview
Add payment, subscription, and plan management to enable a freemium model.

## Utility Files Plan
- `pricing_plans.js`: Utility to define and manage pricing tiers.
- `payment_api.js`: Utility to integrate with payment providers (e.g., Stripe).
- `subscription_manager.js`: Utility to manage user subscriptions and entitlements.

## Integration Plan
- Add a new UI section for plan selection and billing (e.g., modal or page).
- Use utilities to check user plan and restrict premium features accordingly.
- Integrate payment and subscription logic only in new code paths.
- No changes to existing CRUD or UI logic; all pricing logic is additive.
