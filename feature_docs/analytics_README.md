# Analytics

## Overview
Track idea popularity, user engagement, and feature usage.

## Utility Files Plan
- `analytics_tracker.js`: Utility to log and track user actions/events.
- `analytics_dashboard.js`: Utility to display analytics data to admins.

## Integration Plan
- Add analytics tracking calls in new feature code (e.g., upvotes, pitch deck generation).
- Add a dashboard or modal for viewing analytics (admin only).
- No changes to existing CRUD or UI logic; feature is additive and optional.
