# Premium Feature Marking

## Overview
Mark certain features or ideas as "premium" and restrict access to them.

## Utility Files Plan
- `premium_flags.js`: Utility to manage/check premium status for features and users.
- `premium_ui.js`: Utility to display premium badges and lock icons in the UI.

## Integration Plan
- Use `premium_flags.js` to check if a feature is premium before allowing access.
- Use `premium_ui.js` to show premium indicators in the UI.
- Add checks in new feature code only; do not modify existing CRUD or UI logic.
- Premium logic is encapsulated and does not affect existing features.
