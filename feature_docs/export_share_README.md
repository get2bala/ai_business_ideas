# Export/Share Ideas

## Overview
Allow users to export ideas or pitch decks as PDF, PPT, or shareable links.

## Utility Files Plan
- `export_utils.js`: Utility to handle export to PDF, PPT, or link generation.
- `share_ui.js`: Utility to display export/share options in the UI.

## Integration Plan
- Add export/share buttons to idea cards or modals.
- Use utilities to handle export/share actions.
- No changes to existing CRUD or UI logic; feature is additive and optional.
